Smart City Traffic Pattern Prediction
This project predicts traffic patterns in smart cities using machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost. The aim is to develop a tool that can predict future traffic conditions based on historical data, helping city planners and traffic management systems make better decisions.

##Project Overview
The Smart City Traffic Pattern Prediction project aims to provide traffic predictions in a city environment using historical traffic data. It leverages machine learning techniques to predict future traffic flows and help city authorities optimize traffic management. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training using SVM and XGBoost
Model evaluation and comparison
User interface with Streamlit for easy interaction

##Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language used for model training and application development
SVM (Support Vector Machine): Model for traffic pattern prediction
XGBoost: Another model used for prediction to compare performance with SVM
Streamlit: For creating the web-based UI to interact with the model
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualization of traffic data

##Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/bhavyata0210/upskillcampus/blob/main/smart-city-traffic-pattern.ipynb.git
cd smart-city-traffic-pattern

2.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run ap_st.py

##Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes traffic data collected from a smart city. It consists of features such as:

Timestamp (Date and Time)
Vehicle 
junction
Traffic Density
ID

Ensure that the dataset is placed in the correct directory before running the project. The data is preprocessed before being fed into the models.

##Models Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM): The SVM model was trained on the preprocessed data to predict traffic patterns.
XGBoost: XGBoost was used as a meta-learner to further improve the prediction accuracy.
The project uses a meta-learner approach to enhance the prediction accuracy by combining the results of SVM and XGBoost.

##Performance
The combined model achieved an RÂ² Score of 0.9514, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting traffic patterns.

##User Interface
A Streamlit application was implemented to create an interactive user interface. The interface allows users to:
Input traffic data and weather conditions
Visualize traffic trends and patterns
Predict future traffic using the trained model
To access the application:
1.Run the Streamlit app with:
streamlit run ap_st.py

2.The app will open in your browser, where you can input data and see predictions.

##Usage
Load the dataset: You can upload your own traffic dataset through the UI.
Predict Traffic Patterns: Use the interface to predict future traffic conditions based on the input features.
Visualize Results: The application provides visualizations of current and predicted traffic patterns.
